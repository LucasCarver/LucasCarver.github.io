                <h1>Development</h1>
                <p>
                    My development journey began during my time studying electronics at 
                    Macomb Community College. I started writing programs in BASIC with a
                    microcontroller. I wrote simple programs to count, select random 
                    numbers, and control traffic signals. I also wrote a program to 
                    navigate a robot through a maze. From there I began learning of 
                    Assembly. After attaining a basic understanding of how programs 
                    function, I began learning C. After receiving my associates degree, I 
                    had decided that programming was what I wanted to do. I began learning 
                    C++ through Macomb. In my spare time, I learned a bit of Python. I 
                    started taking classes at OU learning Java. This included OOP and Data 
                    Structures. For my sophomore project my group built a password manager 
                    in Java with a focus on security and ease of access. We stored password
                    password data in a SQLite database using AES encryption. It also 
                    implemented keystretching schemes. While the sophomore project was 
                    underway, four of the five of us were working on a network application 
                    for my networking final project. We created an application to 
                    find inputs to a hash function that corespond to specified output. A 
                    client would connect to a server and make a request. The server would 
                    then delegate that task to all connected clients. The clients would try 
                    random inputs to the hash function until a solution was discovered. 
                    The client that found the solution would send the solution to the server 
                    and the server would send a stop message to the clients that failed to 
                    find the solution.

                <h1>Fraser</h1>
                <p>
                    Fraser is a city in Macomb County in Michigan. The city was named for 
                    a lawyer from Detroit. It's a small city with a population of around 
                    15,000 people. Its footprint is a mere four square miles. It has a few 
                    restaurants, some gas stations, and some supermarkets. The weather, 
                    barring winter, tends to be pleasant. There's plenty of critters 
                    including bats, foxes, and rabbits. Deer sightings aren't uncommon. One 
                    might hear screech owls at night.
